# HTTP List Universities
A Python script that creates a server to access a CSV file. You can add, remove and list the lines in the CSV file. It's implemented using Python and HTML with the purpose of using the HTTP functions: GET and POST.

#### Run the server using Python 3.6:

```sh
$ python server.py
```

#### Access it on http://localhost:8000 in your browser, followed by:

*/list* : Lists all the universities in the CSV file
*/new* : Adds a new university name.
*/delete* : Deletes a university name.
